\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this documentation is to provide a simple and concise introduction
to the use and understanding of the Git source control management system.

While the goal of this material is to promote and educate the use of Git, it
is aimed at version control beginners and Git newcomers, and as such some of 
the more complex or convoluted functions of Git will be omitted.

By following the exercises and advice provided in this guide, a user should be
able to gain an understanding of how Git operates, as well as the required
commands to version control their own projects and collaborate with other Git
users.

This guide and its partner presentation are released under the MIT license,
allowing you to alter, amend and redistribute them as you see fit - provided
attribution to the original author is maintained.
